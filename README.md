AI-Powered OS Monitor
📌 Project Overview
The AI-Powered OS Monitor is a smart system tracking tool designed to monitor system performance in real time. With AI-driven anomaly detection, it keeps an eye on CPU usage, memory load, and disk activity, spotting unusual patterns before they cause trouble. The system provides insights and suggestions to help optimize performance, ensuring smooth operation.

✨ Key Features:
✅ Live system monitoring – Tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage in real time.
✅ AI-powered anomaly detection – Uses machine learning to predict performance issues.
✅ Interactive dashboard – Displays system health with alerts and insights.
✅ API support – Allows easy data retrieval and integration with other tools.

🚀 Project Roadmap & Next Steps
✅ Step 1: Train AI for Anomaly Detection
Goal: Improve accuracy in detecting unusual system behavior.

✔ Collect system performance data for training.
✔ Use Isolation Forest, LSTM, or Autoencoder for anomaly detection.
✔ Implement real-time alerts when anomalies are found.

📌 Sample Code – Isolation Forest for CPU Anomaly Detection
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Example CPU usage data (Replace with real system data)
cpu_usage = np.array([20, 22, 21, 19, 85, 23, 20, 22, 95]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Train the model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
model.fit(cpu_usage)

# Detect anomalies
predictions = model.predict(cpu_usage)
anomalies = cpu_usage[predictions == -1]

print("Anomalous CPU Usage:", anomalies)
➡ Next: Integrate this model into the system monitoring tool.

✅ Step 2: Build the API for Data Retrieval
Goal: Create a backend API to fetch real-time system performance data.

✔ Develop an API using Flask or FastAPI.
✔ Set up endpoints for retrieving system health metrics.
✔ Provide data for visualization and alerts.

📌 Sample Code – Flask API for System Monitoring
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import psutil

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/system_status', methods=['GET'])
def get_system_status():
    status = {
        "cpu_usage": psutil.cpu_percent(),
        "memory_usage": psutil.virtual_memory().percent,
        "disk_usage": psutil.disk_usage('/').percent
    }
    return jsonify(status)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
➡ Next: Deploy this API and integrate it with the front-end dashboard.

✅ Step 3: Create an Interactive Dashboard
Goal: Build a user-friendly dashboard to display system health.

✔ Develop a React.js (Web) or Tkinter (Desktop) UI.
✔ Fetch real-time system stats via the API.
✔ Use Chart.js, Plotly, or Matplotlib for live graphs.

📌 Example Features:
🔹 Live CPU & Memory Graphs 📊
🔹 Alerts for High Usage or Anomalies ⚠️
🔹 AI-Based Suggestions for Optimization 💡

📌 Sample Code – React.js Dashboard Fetching Data from API
javascript
Copy
Edit
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function SystemMonitor() {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/system_status')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => setData(data));
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>System Monitor Dashboard</h2>
            {data ? (
                <div>
                    <p>CPU Usage: {data.cpu_usage}%</p>
                    <p>Memory Usage: {data.memory_usage}%</p>
                    <p>Disk Usage: {data.disk_usage}%</p>
                </div>
            ) : (
                <p>Loading data...</p>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}

export default SystemMonitor;
➡ Next: Deploy the dashboard locally or on a cloud platform.

✅ Step 4: Deployment & Testing
Goal: Make the project fully operational and accessible.

✔ Dockerize the application for easy deployment.
✔ Deploy the backend API using Gunicorn + Nginx.
✔ Host the frontend on Vercel, Netlify, or as a local Electron app.
✔ Run tests to check API responses, UI functionality, and AI accuracy.

📌 Example: Running Flask API in Production
sh
Copy
Edit
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
✅ Step 5: Documentation & Final Touches
Goal: Ensure the project is well-documented and ready for public use.

✔ Update README.md with setup instructions and screenshots.
✔ Write API documentation using Swagger or Postman.
✔ Add unit tests for AI and system monitoring components.

📌 Example: Unit Test for API Endpoint (Using pytest)
python
Copy
Edit
import pytest
from app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_system_status(client):
    response = client.get('/api/system_status')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "cpu_usage" in response.json
➡ Next: Push the final changes to GitHub.
